    <p>Gr8er Good Games is on a mission to improve human connections through playful experiences such as scavenger hunts, murder mysteries, and escape games. We design bespoke birthday games, interesting brand activation events and corporate team-building activities for groups from 1 to 1000.

      <ul>
        <li>A 7-course dinner escape game where teams must solve puzzles to unlock each course</li>
        <li>A custom bollywood-style murder mystery with augmented reality and secret actors</li>
        <li>A birthday scavenger hunt where the birthday person received a text message that their birthday present has been stolen and they must go to this store to ask for a clue and follow the puzzles to find the present</li>
        <li>An escape game for remote teams, where each player is shipped a package of materials, puzzles, and locked pouches, and must work together on videochat to solve the clues.</li>
      </ul>
