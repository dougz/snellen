  <p class="disclaimer">This is not a puzzle.</p>

  <p>
    Ensuring the health and safety of all Mystery Hunt participants is
    a top priority. As the leaders of your teams, you are primarily
    responsible for handling emergencies and for ensuring the overall
    health and safety of team members (or designating a responsible
    team member for that role).
  </p>
  <p>
    This document contains important information and helpful
    tips. Read it, learn it, share it, live it.
  </p>

  <h3>Use Common Sense</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>This is a puzzle-solving competition, not a mountain-climbing
    expedition. There is no reason for anyone to put themselves at
    risk of being harmed, arrested, or held liable for any property
    damage. Our actions will also reflect on the Mystery Hunt as a
    whole, so let&rsquo;s stay safe and responsible both for our own
    sakes and for the sake of everyone who loves the Mystery Hunt and
    cares about its future.</li>
    <li><b>Follow our instructions.</b> During hunt, we will
    communicate any important health and safety information on the
    hunt website, by e-mail, by phone, and in person if needed.</li>
    <li>One volunteer on each team should be designated as
    the <b>&ldquo;Health &amp; Safety Marshal.&rdquo;</b> That person
    should be familiar with the information in these guidelines and
    ready to respond if a problem arises while your team is
    hunting.</li>
    <li><b>If you think you are about to do something illegal, unsafe,
    against MIT policy or otherwise ill-advised, CALL HUNT HQ
    FIRST.</b></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Important Contact Information</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>MIT Police: 617-253-1212</b> (or 100 from a campus
    phone). The MIT Police should be contacted in all emergencies,
    whether they are of a criminal, medical, or safety nature, or to
    report an encounter with a suspicious or dangerous person who is
    not participating in the hunt. The MIT Police will dispatch the
    appropriate resources, which in some cases might include the
    student-run MIT-EMS, who will have an ambulance on call.</li>
    <li><b>Hunt HQ Phone: 617-324-7732.</b> Call during hunt if you
    encounter a &ldquo;real-life situation&rdquo; and you do not know
    what to do (medical emergency, lost team member, encounter with
    police, damage to MIT property, etc.).</li>
    <li><b>Hunt Organizers
    E-mail: <a href="mailto:guestservices@pennypark.fun">guestservices@pennypark.fun</a>.</b>
    All incidents should be reported by e-mail after the immediate
    emergency or threat has been managed.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Alerts</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>MIT Alert System:</b> Provides real-time alerts for
    emergencies on campus. We will add at least one contact per team
    just for Hunt weekend (via the Health &amp; Safety Quiz); to
    subscribe permanently,
    visit <a href="http://em2.mit.edu/mitalert/">http://em2.mit.edu/mitalert/</a>.</li>
    <li><b>Fire Alarms:</b> If an alarm sounds, do not continue
    working. All team members must immediately exit the building
    through the nearest marked exit, and wait for further
    instructions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Medical Care</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Urgent Care:</b>
      <ul>
        <li><b>MIT affiliates</b> can use MIT Medical&rsquo;s Urgent
        Care in building E23 for non-emergency treatment,
        8am&ndash;8pm. Overnight, call MIT Medical at 617-253-4481 to
        speak with a nurse, who can schedule a next-day
          appointment.</li>

        <li><b>All Hunt participants</b> may use MIT’s Urgent Care service
        while they are taking part in Mystery Hunt. However, your
        personal insurance will be billed and your insurance might not
        cover the visit if MIT Urgent Care is out of your network.</li>

        <li><b>Non-affiliates</b> can also use area hospitals for urgent
        medical needs. Massachusetts General Hospital, Cambridge
        Hospital, and Mount Auburn Hospital are the closest.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>First Aid:</b> Hunt HQ will provide a kit to each team for
    treating minor issues.  Additional first aid supplies are
    available at HQ.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Know Where You Are</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>MIT is a real university</b>, and Mystery Hunt is not the
    only thing happening. Try not to disturb researchers, staff, and
    other activities that might be occurring on campus. </li>
    <li><b>Don&rsquo;t go anywhere or do anything illegal or
    unsafe.</b> Mystery Hunt takes place in specified rooms and campus
    locations accessible to the MIT community at large. Don&rsquo;t
    attempt to enter other spaces, except locations where events are
    scheduled or that Hunt personnel explicitly provide access to.
    Don&rsquo;t force open locked doors or set off emergency
    alarms.</li>
    <li><b>Don&rsquo;t carry any weapon, or anything that looks like a
    weapon, on campus.</b></li>
    <li><b>Be careful with MIT property</b>, especially if your team
    is using an MIT room as its base. Damage to property will reflect
    poorly on the Mystery Hunt in general and will compromise your
    team’s ability to use MIT rooms in the future.</li>
    <li><b>Team members may not know MIT&rsquo;s campus well.</b>
    Before sending team members on an excursion, you should ensure you
    can stay in touch with them (and vice versa). If needed, provide
    team members with
    maps. <a href="http://whereis.mit.edu">Whereis</a> and
    the <a href="http://m.mit.edu">MIT mobile website</a> both have
    campus maps.</li>
    <li><b>If you think a team member is lost</b>, call them
    directly. If that fails, call Hunt HQ, and if we cannot help,
    contact MIT Police.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Stay Healthy</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Ask if any of your team members have <b>allergies or other
    health conditions</b> that might require attention, and take
    appropriate precautions.</li>
    <li>Make sure every team member has a <b>plan for getting
    sleep</b>. &ldquo;Work until burnout&rdquo; is not a winning
    strategy. Getting sleep is important&mdash;Mystery Hunt is a
    marathon, not a sprint.
      <ul>
        <li><b>MIT rules do not allow sleeping in classrooms, lounges,
        hallways, etc.</b> Make appropriate arrangements so that team
        members can sleep in dorms, hotels or nearby residences. Dorm
        residents hosting hunters should adhere to the guest policies
        of their residence halls.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Be sure team members <b>stay hydrated</b> and
    have <b>nutritious food</b> to eat over the course of the
    weekend. Not just Oreos and Mountain Dew. There are food options
    available nearby in Kendall Square, Central Square, and the MIT
    Student Center.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Minors</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Minors may attend or participate in Mystery Hunt from
    on-campus locations between the hours of 6:00 AM and 1:00 AM.</li>
    <li><b>Minors must be accompanied by a parent/guardian at all
    times</b> or be part of an official school group accompanied by an
    appropriate number of chaperones.</li>
    <li>Minors must travel to and from campus with their
    parent/guardian/school group.</li>
    <li>If you need to interact with an unsupervised minor, have
    another adult present and conduct those interactions in a public
    environment where you can be observed.</li>
    <li>The
    full <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SUdGC5DV97YKieOd8TwNV_d1HiIoqlWQ4P2EcI4wTcA/edit">Regulations
    Regarding the Presence and Participation of Minors</a> should be
    reviewed by every team captain, along with
    the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a6Q0c-gml2rXjrLzrj7ZAk78_t-LRP2I/view">MIT
    Code of Conduct for Working with Minors</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Maintain a Harassment-Free Environment</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The MIT Mystery Hunt is dedicated to providing a
    harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender,
    gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability,
    physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion. We do not
    tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Participants
    asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
    immediately.</li>
    <li>MIT policies expressly prohibit harassment, including sexual
    harassment, sexual misconduct, gender-based harassment and
    stalking. All teams and participants must abide
    by <a href="https://policies.mit.edu/policies-procedures/90-relations-and-responsibilities-within-mit-community/94-harassment">MIT&rsquo;s
    Harassment Policy</a>. Hunt participants violating this policy may
    be expelled from Mystery Hunt at the organizers&rsquo;
    discretion.</li>
    <li>If you would like to report harassment, please remove yourself
    from the uncomfortable situation and contact Hunt HQ by email
    at <a href="mailto:guestservices@pennypark.fun">guestservices@pennypark.fun</a>.</li>
    <li>Team captains should make sure this policy is understood by
    all team members and should actively discourage harassment within
    and among teams.</li>
  </ul>
