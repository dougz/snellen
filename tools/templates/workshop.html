      After teams solved their first meta puzzle, they received a visit from two of the Loonie Toonies informing them that they now had access to the Tinkerer's Workshop and instructing them to send two team members to speak to the Tinkerer.</p>

    <p>Upon arriving at the Tinkerer's Workshop, they had the opportunity to use our pressed penny machines (custom made by Ben de Bivort and Ofer Mazor!) to create a celebratory penny to commemorate their achievements. Inner lands generated one penny a piece; outer lands generated two.  Solving all the Events generated an additional penny. Each penny came attached to a card to commemorate the land that they celebrated.

<p>You can find images of all the pennies and the accompanying text for each penny below:</p>

    <h3>The Grand Castle</h3>
    <p>Few know that Penny’s Castle was originally meant to be a temporary structure. But as the park grew, patrons relied on it to help them navigate the sprawling grounds. At the front of the castle, you can pretend to be someone else by dressing up as a royal guard or court jester!</p>

    <h3>Storybook Forest</h3>
    <p>Storybook Forest is a great place to discover new stories. As the first world inside the main gates, patrons often head here immediately after landing in the park. Something amazing is guaranteed to happen here, and newspapers will often cover it!</p>

    <h3>Wizard's Hollow</h3>
    <p>Zippy is one word that comes to mind when describing our quick-service Wizard's Hollow gift shop. Buy kits to perform tricks like the Disappearing Coin or The Ol’ Switcheroo. Or pick up some branded apparel: everyday wizards wear hoodies and caps, while a high-ranking one wears ornate robes.</p>

    <p>Coming attractions: The Wreck-It Ralph Arcade, where you can spend all your quarters. And The Director's Eye, where you can get a shot set up and then film it. But watch out for agents—one may get in your face with an overly aggressive pitch for a script!</p>

  	<center><img src=SVG/cascade1_penny.svg width=100></center>

  	<h3>Cascade Bay 2</h3>
    <p>Catch some majestic air in the Soarin’ Splasher, the next ride to debut in Cascade Bay. With space for one passenger, each pod takes its rider 100 feet up ... then 150 feet down! Since each ride lasts just 5 seconds, the real feat is how much it runs each day.</p>

    <h3>Cactus Canyon 1</h3>
    <p>Cactus Canyon’s length at its widest point is a full 200 furlongs. The gold mine at its heart was once quite a lucrative enterprise! It was an astonishing turn when the mine ran dry; that's when it was turned into a theme park.</p>

  	<center><img src=SVG/cactus1_penny.svg width=100></center>

    <p>Be sure to catch the High Noon Shootout and Aquatic Stunt show, filled with action and danger. Or visit the Ol' Gulch Tavern, where a brawl is staged each night. You can visit our vintage photo booth and get a picture of yourself working a quaint, old-timey job.</p>
